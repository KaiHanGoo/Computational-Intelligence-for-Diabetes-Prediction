Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide. It affects millions of people and puts a heavy burden on healthcare systems. Diabetes happens when blood glucose levels are too high, either because the body does not make enough insulin or cannot use insulin properly. Managing and diagnosing diabetes early is very important to prevent serious health problems like heart disease, kidney failure, and nerve damage. Recently, the use of Computational Intelligence (CI) in healthcare has grown because it can help improve clinical decision-making, enhance the accuracy of diagnoses, and improve treatment plans. CI approaches, such as Fuzzy Sets and Systems, Evolutionary Algorithms, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) or Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), are good at handling large amounts of medical data. They provide useful insights that can help improve patient outcomes.

However, using CI in healthcare also has challenges. One major challenge is that large, high-quality datasets are needed to train models well. But getting such datasets can be difficult because of privacy issues, difficulties accessing data, and the complexity of medical information. Another problem is overfitting, where models perform well on training data but do not work well on new data. Healthcare models also need to be easy to understand, as doctors and healthcare workers must trust and understand how the system makes decisions to ensure patient safety. Lastly, the models should be simple to use and fit easily into the daily routines of healthcare workers without needing too much technical skill.

This project will seek to solve these problems by using the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset, which is available to the public and can help predict diabetes. This dataset is a good choice for exploring how CI methods can be used to solve real medical problems like predicting diabetes while dealing with issues like overfitting.

Overall, this project aims to show how CI can improve healthcare by giving reliable, easy-to-understand, and interpretable solutions for predicting and managing diabetes. This will help improve patient outcomes and assist healthcare professionals in making better decisions.
